Taking advantage from the Global Early Instrumental Monthly Meteorological Multivariable Database, the HCLIM (Historical Climate Dataset) provides a full compilation of historical climate records dating back before 1890 and offers a unique opportunity to apply advanced geostatistical methods to predict climate variables at a specific location, at a specific date.

HCLIM provide with public dataset concerning monthly values for **TEMPERATURE**, **PRECIPITATION**, **WET DAYS** and **PREASSURE**. The collection totals 12,452 records (meteorological time series with one variable at one location) in 118 countries and more than 10 million rows.

Below are the location of the 12,000 stations:
