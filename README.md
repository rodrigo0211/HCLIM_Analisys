Taking advantage from the Global Early Instrumental Monthly Meteorological Multivariable Database, the HCLIM (Historical Climate Dataset) provides a full compilation of historical climate records dating back before 1890 and offers a unique opportunity to apply advanced geostatistical methods to predict climate variables at a specific location, at a specific date.
